# Uploading misc programs with different purposes.

1. The "mreza" is a program based on my need to calculate the optimal way to fit a grid defined by a number of rows and columns into a piece of paper of certain dimensions. The grid is put over a picture inside a drawing/text editing program, the rows and columns are numerated and the same grid with the calculated dimensions and margins can be recreated on paper. That way you can reproduce the picture on the screen by yourself just by drawing part by part.
