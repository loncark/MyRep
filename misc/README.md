# Uploading misc programs with different purposes.

1. The "mreza" is a program based on my need to calculate the optimal way to fit a grid defined by a number of rows and columns into a piece of paper of certain dimensions. The grid is put over a picture inside a drawing/text editing program, the rows and columns are numerated and the same grid with the calculated dimensions and margins can be recreated on paper. That way you can reproduce the picture on the screen by yourself just by drawing part by part.

2. "konverzija" file is a mini-program designed to transform a text from a textual file using a specific function, it was made for my friend's art project.

3. "tictactoe" is a tic-tac-toe game simulation in command prompt (without rendering).

4. I was given two weeks to make the Breakout game during a student job interview - ended up with a functional game in 8 days. YAY! Taking into account I have never made a game from scratch, I am super-satisfied. It really was a challenge to learn from all sorts of sources, mostly Youtube, C++ reference sites and StackOverflow. I may ocasionally upload a pdf with instructions.

Everything else is college-related (SFML Tetris and Bouncy balls, vector implementation and a HTML code generator).
